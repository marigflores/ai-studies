# ai-studies
A repository to keep my artificial intelligence studies from college and other online resources.

This repository includes the exercises from a program i have done at Estácio University in Brazil about artificial intelligence for developers. I used Google Colab with Jupyter Notebooks for all of them except nlp-tokenization which was on my computer. The files are:

- clusterizacao.ipynb
- cancer-deeplearning.ipynb
- estimativa-densidade.ipynb
- machine-learning-classification-diabetes.ipynb
- nlp-tokenization.ipynb
- reducao-dimensional.ipynb
- speech-recognition.ipynb
- visao-computacional.ipynb

In general the subjects were: clusters, deep learning, estimating density, machine learning classification of diabetes, natural language processing tokenization, dimensional reduction, linear regression, speech recognition and computational vision.

side note: these were studies to see how things work while following the book, there are a few errors due to how old some of the tasks requirements are, some from 2020, so a few modules that were recommended on these homeworks were incompatible with my current device and i couldn't find the right ones to make it work. Sorry. But most of them do work now after some tweaking with the code and research.
